My name is Fangjun Zhou. I'm a computer science student working on computer graphics and computer vision research.

I was previously a game developer. I've worked on a Unity open-source framework and several indie games.

This is my [blog](https://fangjunzhou.github.io). I'll post articles on computer graphics, computer vision, high-performance computing, and game development here.

Here's my [memo page](https://memos.puffedpescado.com/). I'll share my thoughts here (i.e., shitpost).
