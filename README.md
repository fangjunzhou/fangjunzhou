My name is Fishball. I'm a game developer. I'm a computer science student interested in all kinds of cutting-edge technology, including computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I developed several personal projects and participated in some open-source projects. I deeply understood how to use algorithms, data structures, and design patterns in practice.

This is my [blog](https://fangjun-zhou.github.io). I'll post some articles related to game developing, computer graphics, and machine learning here.
